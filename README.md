# OpenGenus: World's first Offline Search Engine

This is the World's first Offline code Search Engine presented by OpenGenus Foundation. You can, now, search code for any algorithm or data-structure in your favorite language even when you are _not connected to the internet_. 

Get your offline code search engine from [**Chrome Web Store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opengenus-offline-search/lfoloadpfjildomeafpdopahkdaoofbn)

We are on a mission to bring the best parts of the Internet Offline, enable people to work offline for a longer period of time and revolutionize the way people interact with the web. 

"We made the internet and it made us vulnerable. We fought and we won."

The best part is that the massive effort put to build this awesome search engine is open to all. Yes, we are an open-source organization and over 1000 people have become an integral part of our family in our ambitious journey. You can help us too.
