**Fixes issue:**
<!-- [Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesn't has a specific issue. -->


**Changes:**
-Having a bigger and centrally placed search box would further improve the browsing experience.
-User Login can be added to access favorites on any system after logging in.
-Extension filter can be added so that user can look for programs in a particular language of their choice (.cpp, .py, .swift etc.)
-It would be nice and convenient to have Syntax highlighted code instead of having it in plain text.
-Also I have tried integrating features suggested in previous issues - Drop down list showing favourites, Search Icon, Help, Setting etc.)
