# Insertion Sort

**Overview:** Algorithm will construct a sorted array/list of elements one item at a time. With each iteration, the algorithm takes one element from the input data, identifies the ordered location in the new sorted array/list, then inserts the element. This is repeated until all the input data has been orderly inserted into the array/list.


**Time Complexity:** O(n*n)
